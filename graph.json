          "Vyasa_commentary": "\u201cNow.\u201d\u2014This word here denotes undertaking. A text giving a revised critical teaching of Yoga is to be understood as having been undertaken.Yoga is contemplation (Sam\u0101dhi, trance), and it is a characteristic of the mind pervading all its planes. The planes of the mind are:Wandering (K\u1e63ipta); Forgetful (M\u016b\u1e0dha); Occasionally steady or distracted (Vik\u1e63ipta); One-pointed (Ek\u0101gra); and Restrained (Niruddha),Of these the contemplation in the occasionally steady mind does not fall under the heading of Yoga, because of unsteadiness appearing in close sequence. That however, which in the one-pointed mind, fully shows forth an object existing as such in its most perfect form, removes the afflictions, loosens the bonds of karma and thus inclines it towards restraint, is said to be the Cognitive Trance (Sa\u1e43praj\u00f1\u0101ta Sam\u0101dhi). And we shall explain further that this is accompanied by philosophical curiosity (vitarka), meditation (vic\u0101ra), bliss (\u0101nanda), and egoism (asmit\u0101).When however all the modifications come under restraint, the trance is ultra-cognitive (Asa\u1e43praj\u00f1\u0101ta Sam\u0101dhi).",
          "Sankara_commentary": "(Opponent) If the s\u016btra has been presented to give this definition, it should have been \u2018Yoga has inhibition of the mental processes\u2019; to put them in apposition is not right, for a definition should not be simply the thing defined. Or at any rate it should have been said, \u2018The definition is, inhibition of the mental processes.\u2019\n\n(Answer) A definition is projected (adhyas) on to the thing defined. When we say \u2018This person is Devadatta\u2019 there is a projection (adhy\u0101sa) of the definition on to the thing defined. So there is no fault.\n\nThe omission of the word All shows that the cognitive (sam\u0101dhi) too is yoga.\n\n(Opponent) (The commentator\u2019s previous gloss) But the ultra-cognitive is when there is inhibition of all mental processes is also a definition of it, so the s\u016btra should have been \u2018Yoga is inhibition of all mental processes.\u2019 This has not been said and the definition is too wide.\n\n(Answer) As to why the word All is omitted from the s\u016btra, he says that if All were put in, it would be denying that the cognitive sam\u0101dhi, which comes about by restricting the processes to a single point, is yoga at all. To prevent that, the word All is left out.\n\n(Opponent) If so, the cognitive and ultra-cognitive have the same definition and are not in fact distinguished.\n\n(Answer) The subject is yoga, as we see from the repetition of the word (in the first two s\u016btra-s). And unless he did intend a distinction, there would have been no point in putting into the definition the word yoga (which is well known to include meditation on objects).\n\n(Opponent) The word yoga is of minor importance for actual exposition; it would suit the purpose of exposition if the definition just said \u2018Inhibition of the mental processes\u2019 without the word yoga at all.\n\n(Answer) Not so, because what was introduced was an exposition of yoga, and it is exposition of yoga that has been begun, not exposition of non-yoga. The proposed definition could have too many contexts and would not be connected to the meaning of the words \u2018exposition of yoga\u2019. For the idea of an exposition of yoga does not follow from the words \u2018inhibition of mental processes\u2019.\n\n(Opponent) Why then should the word yoga lead to a definition of the ultra-cognitive sam\u0101dhi alone, and not to a definition of the cognitive, if there is no such distinction in the word itself?\n\n(Answer) Because it applies exactly. What applies loosely is not a definition of a thing. The definition as inhibition applies exactly to the ultra-cognitive sam\u0101dhi, but only loosely to the cognitive. Having horns is not the mark of cow-ness, because it applies also to buffaloes and other animals.\n\n(Opponent) Neither is inhibition exact as a definition of the ultra-cognitive; (it is too loose) because there is inhibition in the cognitive too, namely inhibition of the undesired mental processes.\n\n(Answer) True, but the ultra-cognitive cannot be defined by anything else except inhibition. Inhibition alone is its definition because nothing else is there, whereas the cognitive is definable in terms of special characteristics like verbal associations. As a parallel case, when tangibility is cited as a defining mark, it is the element Air alone that is defined by the fact of tangibility, which is regarded as special to it, though in fact tangibility is found also in the other elements in the descending order from Fire (to Water and then Earth).\n\nThus the word yoga is simply a corroboration (anuv\u0101da), and so it is that All has not been put in the s\u016btra. It is settled that the ultra-cognitive is defined by the bare word \u2018inhibition\u2019, and if \u2018All (the mental processes)\u2019 were included, it would deny that the cognitive also is yoga. Therefore this is the definition of ultra-cognitive alone, and the commentator will sum up later in these words: Ultra-cognitive (a-sam-praj\u00f1\u0101ta) in the sense that in it no thing is cognized (sam-praj\u00f1\u0101yate): this yoga is inhibition of the mental process.\n\nWhat is the nature of that mind, inhibition of whose processes is called yoga? To explain mind and its processes and their inhibition, the commentator says:\n\nNow mind always tends towards illumination, activity, or stasis (sthiti); so it consists of the three gu\u1e47a-s.\n\nMind is said to consist of the three gu\u1e47a-s, because it is always tending towards illumination, activity, or stasis. Illumination is making known, bringing to light, that being characteristic of sattva gu\u1e47a. Activity is motion and operation, that being characteristic of rajas. Stasis is being stationary, limitation, and resistance, such being characteristic of tamas. These are the invariable tendencies of the gu\u1e47a-s, and as mind is always tending towards one of them, it is true to say that it is continual transformation of the three gu\u1e47a-s.\n\nTo the objection that illumination and the others have not been established as causes, he says:\n\nFor mind-sattva is by nature illumination.\n\nThe word For means that this is something generally accepted; it is well known in the world and from scripture how mind makes everything manifest. So mind is sattva, and is therefore called mind-sattva, because its main transformation is that of sattva.\n\nOr again, mind can be pointed out clearly as pure knowledge (khy\u0101ti) having other mental processes mutually combining and separating. So it is that he says For mind-sattva is by nature illumination.\n\nMingled with rajas and tamas, mind is drawn towards power and possessions. Pervaded by tamas, it becomes subject to a-dharma, Ignorance, attachment and helplessness. That same mind, when the covering of illusion (moha) has dwindled, pervaded by a measure of rajas, is endowed with dharma, knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na), detachment and power. When the last trace of the stain of rajas is removed, the mind is grounded in its own nature, becoming simply the Knowledge (khy\u0101ti) that sattva and Puru\u1e63a are different, and it is endowed with the Rain-cloud of Dharma, which the meditators call the highest prasa\u1e45khy\u0101na (continuous meditation on Knowledge).\n\nNow he explains the conflicting varieties of mental processes which arise from relative dominance or subordination of rajas and tamas. When sattva is predominant, but mingled with rajas and tamas, they being equally strong, mind becomes fond of power and possessions, and this fondness for them is passion. The meaning is, that thoughts arise concentrated on the passion for power and possessions.\n\nWhen that mind, which is illumination by nature, is pervaded by tamas, with rajas subordinate in it, then tainted thoughts arise of a-dharma and the other three (Ignorance, passion, and helplessness).\n\nThat same mind, when the covering of illusion has dwindled, when tamas has been overcome, as when the rain-cloud passes away the darkness is at an end and the sun-disc illumines everything pervaded by a measure by a trace of rajas, is endowed with dharma, etc. (knowledge, detachment, and power), and pure thoughts of dharma and the others arise.\n\nWhen the last stain of the trace of rajas is removed, the mind is grounded in its own nature in its own nature as illumination and that alone. It becomes simply the Knowledge that sattva and Puru\u1e63a are different. Mind is sattva, and Puru\u1e63a is the experiencer (bhokt\u1e5b); discriminating them as different is Knowledge (khy\u0101ti) of them, awareness of them. The word simply indicates that it is free from taints or any other things (than Knowledge). It is endowed with the meditation called Rain-cloud of Dharma, this being the sam\u0101dhi of that name.\n\nThe mind overcomes rajas and tamas by power of prasa\u1e45khy\u0101na, which is meditation (dhy\u0101na) established in the perception of the nature of Puru\u1e63a alone, pure Knowledge itself, which the meditators the yogins call the highest prasa\u1e45khy\u0101na (continuous meditation on Knowledge).\n\nThe power-of-consciousness is unchangeable, does not engage with objects, has the objects shown to it, is pure and infinite.\n\nHaving explained what the mental process is in itself, he shows how it is to be inhibited. The power-of-consciousness (citi-\u015bakti) is unchangeable: consciousness alone is power, so it is called power-of-consciousness. Powers which blossom out only in births appropriate to the possession of those powers are not inherent power, but consciousness is inherent power, dependent on nothing else. It is therefore eternally established. The apposition of the word consciousness (citi) meaning pure consciousness (cinm\u0101tra) and the word power (\u015bakti) is to show that the subjective consciousness is of unvarying nature. This being so, it is something unchanging. When in an abiding possessor-of-qualities (dharmin), one quality (dharma) gives way to a different one, that is called change. Since this consciousness never changes, it is unchanging. For just this reason, it does not engage with objects. For it is only things like mind, which do change, that are found to engage with objects.\n\nSo the various objects are shown to it: an object is shown to it through the mind (anta\u1e25-kara\u1e47a). Therefore it is pure and therefore in space and in time it is infinite. (In this explanation which has been given) each fact is to be understood as the cause of the next one.\n\nOpposed to pure consciousness is Knowledge-of-the-difference (viveka-khy\u0101ti), whose nature is sattva-gu\u1e47a. Therefore the mind, turning away from even that Knowledge, inhibits it.\n\nAn example of the contrary is mind and senses. Opposed to pure consciousness is Knowledge-of-the-difference, whose nature is sattva-gu\u1e47a. Sattva-gu\u1e47a means pure sattva, and its essence is that alone. To say that its nature is sattva means that its nature is essentially to illumine. Again, it is said to be essentially sattva-gu\u1e47a because this thought is not concerned with any object of the world.\n\nAgain, Knowledge is bound by the very fact of being Knowledge, just because it is essentially sattva. This Knowledge being thus distinct from, and opposed to, the characteristics of the power-of-consciousness described, does have changes and so on.\n\nBeing associated with qualities like change, it is inferior to the supreme Puru\u1e63a which is free from them. Therefore because it sees the defect (do\u1e63a) in its own nature, the mind, turning away from giving up even that Knowledge, inhibits it.\n\nIn this state what remains is sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra-s, and it is the seedless (nirb\u012bja) sam\u0101dhi. There is no cognition of anything in it, so it is ultra-cognitive. This yoga is inhibition of the mental processes.\n\nIn this state the state of inhibition what remains is sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra-s; only sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra-s are left. This sam\u0101dhi in this state of inhibition is the seedless. The meaning is, that here the seed is gone; in this all the seeds of taint and so on are gone.\n\nTo show this very mark of the ultra-cognitive sam\u0101dhi, he quotes the s\u016btra, This yoga is inhibition of the mental processes.\n\nWhat is Puru\u1e63a, the cognizer of buddhi (buddhi-bodh\u0101tman), in that state when there is no object for him?",

          "Vacaspati_commentary": "Bhagav\u0101n Pata\u00f1jali here composed the aphorism, \u201cNow a revised text of Yoga,\u201d with the object of stating briefly the subject of the treatise he desired to write, so that it may attract the intelligent student and also that the reader may be able to understand with ease.The word \u2018Now\u2019 (atha) the first of the sentence is explained:\u2014\u201c\u2018Now\u201d:\u2014This word here denotes undertaking.\u201dThis word \u2018now\u2019 does not here denote sequence, as it does in, \u201c\u2018Now\u2019 there is light.\u201dThe word \u2018anu\u015b\u0101sana\u2019 means here a text-book, the derivative meaning being that by which something is taught; and this cannot be begun in sequence of the performance of mental and physical restraint. On the contrary however the desire to know and the knowledge of realities appear in sequence of the desire to explain the knowledge of realities. As says the Veda \u201cTherefore let him see the self, in the self\u201d after having controlled the mind and the senses and become desireless, enduring and contemplative, (Br. U. IV. 4. 23).Although it is possible that the questioning of a student the performance of purificatory actions (tapas), and employment of alchemy may serve as antecedents, they are not to be taken as such here, because the recognition and taking up of the study by a student are of no use in making a treatise on Yoga authoritative. Even if there should be no student for the time being, the work should be undertaken if authoritative. If however not authoritative, it should be given up, even though there be a student asking for it The existence of an immediate sequence between the knowledge of truth and the desire to explain it is hereby refuted.If, however, the meaning is to be taken to be undertaking, then by speaking of the Yoga to be discussed by undertaking the work, the whole meaning and object of the work is set forth; and the student is easily informed and set to work in the belief that trance is the means of the highest good, as set forth in the Vedas, the Sm\u1e5btis, the Itih\u0101sas, and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as.The question arises, Is the word \u2018Now\u2019 to be taken to mean undertaking in all works? Because in that case it would mean the same in the Ved\u0101nta S\u016btra.Ath\u0101to Brahmajij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101.\u201cNow then a desire to know Brahma.\u201d\u2014I.1.1.To meet this objection the Commentator specifies \u2018This word here, &c.Another doubt arises. How is Patanjali, the author of the Yoga Teaching, when we have it in the Sm\u1e5bti of the Yog\u012b Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, that Hira\u1e47yagarbha and no other ancient was the original teacher of Yoga. For this reason the author of the aphorisms has used the word \u2018Anu\u015b\u0101sana\u2019 (revised text) which means teaching after it has already been taught, not only teaching.Because the word \u2018Now\u2019 means here an undertaking, the Commentator says that the meaning is that, \u2018a text giving a revised critical teaching of Yoga is to be understood as having been undertaken.\u2019But why should it be said that a work teaching Yoga is undertaken here? It is Yoga itself that is intended to be discussed here.For this reason is it said:\u2014\u2018Is to be understood, &c.\u2019 It is true that Yoga is spoken of as the subject of discussion here. It can, however, be discussed only by means of a work treating of the subject. The action of the teacher works through the instrument and does not directly operate upon the object. With the object of specifically mentioning the action of the teacher, his work treating of the subject of Yoga is to be understood as having been undertaken. Yoga, however, is to be undertaken as the subject of the work.It should also be known that the hearing of the sound of the word \u2018atha\u2019(now) when used to denote undertaking, is considered auspicious, like the sight of a jar full of water, which some one may be carrying.The Commentator now removes the doubt as to the meaning of the word \u2018Yoga,\u2019 which arises from its ordinary connotation. Thus says he, \u201cYoga is contemplation.\u201d The word \u2018Yoga\u2019 is derived from the root \u221ayuj, to contemplate, and not from the root Yujir, to join, in which latter case it would mean conjunction.Another question arises again. Trance (Sam\u0101dhi) is to be described later on as being only a branch of Yoga. How can it then be that a part only may be the whole?The Commentator adds, for this reason:\u2014\u2018and it pervades all its planes.\u2019 It is the word \u2018and\u2019 (ca) which distinguishes the whole from the part.The planes are the states to be mentioned later on, the Madhumat\u012b, the Madhuprat\u012bk\u0101, and the Vi\u015bok\u0101. They are the states of the mind in which the potencies only are left in residue in the mind. Yoga, defined as the restraint of mental modifications, is present in all these planes, i.e., in all these states of the mind. Not so the trance which is only a branch of it.Yoga is given here only its root meaning of contemplation, because the statement is made here only as an incentive to study, without intending to emphasize the distinction between the whole and the part. The real meaning of the word \u2018Yoga\u2019 is only the restraint of mental modifications.For the refutation of those who say that the restraint of mental modifications is dependent upon the self, by reason of the modifications themselves being cognitions and therefore dependent upon the self, it is said:\u2014\u2018and it is a characteristic of the mind/By the word \u2018mind\u2019 (citta) the internal organ, the will-to-know is hinted at. The power of consciousness, which is constant in its eternity and thus unchangeable, cannot have the faculty of knowledge for its characteristic. The will-to-be, which is the same as the will-to-know, however may. This is the meaning.Grant that, but if the Yoga pervades all the mental planes, then, the wandering, the forgetful and the distracted planes of the mind too should be understood by the word \u2018Yoga\u2019 showing as they do the restraint of certain mental modifications relatively to the others. To remove this doubt, the planes to be taken and rejected as falling within \u2018Yoga\u2019 are mentioned, beginning with the word, \u2018wandering, &c.The wandering plane or condition of the mind is that in which it is always thrown by disturbing Energy (Rajas) towards these and those objects, and is thus extremely unsteady.In the forgetful condition, the mind is possessed of the modification of deep sleep on account of the excess of inertia (the quality of Tamas).The occasionally steady or distracted is differentiated from the wandering. The difference consists in the occasional steadiness of that which is for the most part unsteady.This excess of its unsteadiness is either acquired, or brought about by the obstacles of disease, disinclination, &c., to be mentioned later.The one-pointed is that which moves along one line only.The restrained mind is that in which all the mental modifications have been restrained, and exist only as potencies.Of these, the wandering and the forgetful modifications are not denied here expressly the status of Yoga, being far removed as they are from that state, inasmuch as notwithstanding the existence of relative restraint in them, they do not even form links in the chain of causes which lead to the highest good, and because they are in conflict with the nature thereof. To the occasionally steady, however, the status of Yoga is expressly denied, because in this case it is possible to mistake it as such on account of its occasional manifestation of steadiness over existing objects of knowledge. In the occasionally steady mind the contemplation does not fall under the heading of Yoga consisting as it does only of an occasional steadiness of the mind over an existing object. Why? Because it is followed in close sequence by its contrary state of unsteadiness and in application. Having fallen as it does in the midst of the manifestations of a contrary class, its very nature becomes difficult to distinguish from -the very first as cause or effect, A seed which has remained in fire even for three or four seconds, will most certainly not sprout into leaves, even though sown.Which contemplative mental state is then Yoga, if not the one which follows or is followed closely by unsteadiness?\u2018That however which in the one-pointed mind, &c.\u2019The words \u2018existing as such\u2019 keep out an object whose existence is only fastened upon the reality. The words, \u2018in its roost perfect form\u2019 are used to signify the best, i.e., that which manifests its essence to its utmost capacity. This is mentioned because the phenomenon of deep sleep also has a mind directed towards the one point which is its then object; that is to say, the quality of inertia (tamas) which though characterized by the absence of all other mental phenomena, does still exist as such; and the excess of inertia is bad because it is the cause of the afflictions.The word, \u2018fully\u2019 is used to qualify the words, \u2018shows forth, because the showing forth, i.e., the knowledge of the realities may be accomplished by verbal and inferential cognitions also. Knowledge so obtained however, is not competent to remove nescience (avidy\u0101) which is directly present in the mind; whereas inferential and verbal knowledge are after all indirect, the object being absent. The word \u2018fully\u2019 (pra) signifies intensity, and therefore indicates direct perceptual knowledge. The present sight of two moons and the doubt as to any particular direction of space go on existing, even though inference and authority point the other way.Egoism and the other afflictions have their root in nescience. The appearance of knowledge means the removal of nescience. Egoism and other afflictions are also removed on the appearance of knowledge, because they are contrary thereto, and because the cause of their existence is destroyed. For this reason the words, \u2018removes the afflictions\u2019 have been added to the description.For the same reason does it loosen the bonds in the shape of actions (karma). It is non-antecedent action that is desired to be understood here, by using the word denoting the cause to mean the effect.\u2018Loosens\u2019 means renders unfit for the production of effects. It will be said further, \u201cIt ripens into life-time, life-state and life-experience, if the root exists.\u201d\u2014II.13.\u201cAnd inclines it towards restraint\u201d means that it was not so inclined before.This cognitive trance is four-fold. Hence is it said, \u2018This is accompanied, &c.\u2019The ultra-cognitive trance is described by the words,\u2018When however all the modifications, &c.\u2019In the cognitive trance are restrained those mental modifications of real cognition, &c., which are of the nature of disturbing energy and inertia (rajas and tamas): and this is done by resort to the class of mental modifications which are of the nature of the essence (sattva). In the ultra-cognitive, however, all modifications are restrained. This is the meaning.The mental planes of Madhumat\u012b, &c., which find their end in these two states, are all the planes. That which pervades all these planes is called S\u0101rvabhauma, all-pervading."

          "Vacaspati_commentary": "Now says he, in order to introduce the next aphorism:\u2014\u201cThere being no object of cognition in that state of the mind, &c.\u201d The word \u2018what\u2019 is inquisitive. The meaning is this. The conscious principle is always perceived as the very self of the cognitions of the Will-to-know taking on the forms of various objects. He is never perceived as separate from the cognitions of the Will-to-know. For this reason the knowledge of the will-to-be is of the very nature of the conscious principle, as light of the sun. And it does not exist when the mind is in a state of residual potency (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra). And no existence can last as such when it has given up its nature.Let it be so. But then why does not the Puru\u1e63a know the Will-to-be in its state of residual potency? To meet this he says:\u2014\u201cThere being no object of cognition, &c.\u201dIt is not the Will-to-know alone, but the Will-to-know which has the objects of the Puru\u1e63a to achieve that is the sphere of consciousness. The objects of the Puru\u1e63a are discriminative knowledge and the experience of the objective world. These two no longer exist in the state of inhibition (nirodha). Therefore the non-existence of objects in that state is established. The author gives the answer by the aphorism\u2014\u201cThen the seer stands in his own nature.\u201dBy the word \u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 (his own nature), the author excludes the appearances of the calm, the ruffled and the forgetful (the Santa, the Ghora and the M\u016b\u1e0dha) which have been fastened upon it. The nature of the Puru\u1e63a is consciousness alone, unaffected by the contacts (of objects placed alongside), not the cognitive action of the Will-to-know appearing as calm, &c. This is of the nature of contacts. It is like the redness which appears in a crystal pure white by nature, when a Japa flower is placed in contact therewith. And it is not necessary that when the things placed in contact are removed, the thing with which they have been placed in contact, should also disappear. That would mean encroachment of the one into the sphere of the other. The locative case is used, because the thing and the nature of the thing are conceived as being separate, although in reality the same, and not distinct.The same meaning is rendered clear by the Commentator:\u2014\u201cAt that time the power of consciousness, &c.\u201d At that time, in the state of restraint and not in the state of outgoing.Let that be so. But then the power of consciousness, not standing in its own nature when the Will-to-be is in the state of outgoing activity, and becoming established in that state when in the state of inhibition; becomes changeful. If it be said that it remains established in its own nature even in the state of outgoing activity, then there would be no difference between the states of outgoing activity and inhibition. For this reason says the author\u2018In the outwardly inclined mind, &c.\u2019The power of consciousness, constant because standing alone, is never disturbed in its own nature; and for this reason is the same inactivity as in the state of restraint. The mother-of-pearl does not for certain, put on and give up its true nature, while becoming the object of true or false knowledge. The knower, however, fancies it to be something different from what it really is.In relation to the Inhibitive Trance, the Cognitive Trance also is a state of outgoing activity.",
          "Vyasa_commentary": "There being no object of cognition in that state of the mind, what is the state of the conscious principle (puru\u1e63a) who has identified himself with the cognitions of the Will-to-be? \u201cThen the seer stands in his own nature.\u201d At that time the power of consciousness is established in its own nature, as in the state of perfect freedom. In the outgoing mind it appears to be not so centred in its own nature, though in reality it is the same."

          "Vacaspati_commentary": "For the purpose of introducing another aphorism, the author puts the question, \u2018How then?\u2019 The meaning is this. In what manner does it shine then, if it is not perceived to be what it really is. Adding the word which explains the cause, he reads the aphorism:\u2014\u201cOn account of objects being presented to it, identification with modifications takes place elsewhere.\u201dElsewhere:\u2014In the state of outward activity, whatever may be the modifications of the mind, the calm, the ruffled, and the forgetful, the same are the manifestations of the conscious principle as he exists in that state.The word Sa in S\u0101r\u016bpya (identification) means oneness. This is the meaning. The notions, \u2018I am calm.\u2019 \u2018I am ruffled,\u2019 \u2018I am forgetful\u2019, appear by fastening the modifications of the will-to-be upon the conscious principle, by taking the will-to-know and the conscious principle to be one on account of proximity, as in the case of the white crystal and the Japa flower. This happens in the same way as one looking his face reflected in a dirty mirror, becomes anxious and thinks, \u2018I am dim.\u2019 Although the fastening of the conscious principle upon the will-to-know, is like the knowledge of sound, &c., only a manifestation of the will-to-know, and although this manifestation must be considered to be unintelligent, having, as it does, its origin in the Prak\u1e5bti, showing forth as it does the will-to-know as the knower, the manifestation shines forth as a manifestation of consciousness. And similarly does this \u0100tma (self) appear to possess false knowledge, although in reality he has no false knowledge. He appears as the enjoyer, although he is not the enjoyer. He appears as possessed of discriminative knowledge, and illuminated thereby although devoid of it in reality.This will be shown further under the aphorisms:\u2014\u201cConsciousness not moving, takes its form and thus the will-to-know knows itself as such.\u201d\u201422.4.\u201cEnjoyment (Bhoga) consists in the identification of the notions of the Objective Essence and the Conscious principle (puru\u1e63a), which are quite distinct from each other.\u201d\u201434.3.The Commentator now says that this is recognized by another school also.\u201cSo is the aphorism, &c.\u201dThe aphorism \u201cknowledge is but one; discrimination alone is knowledge,\u201d is an aphorism of the \u0100c\u0101rya Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikh\u0101.But how is knowledge but one? The modifications of the will-to-be in the shape of the objects, sound, &c., and in the shape of discrimination, are to be considered Unintelligent. This is one knowledge. The intelligence of the Puru\u1e63a is distinct from it. Its recognition also is knowledge. For this reason says, \u201cDiscrimination alone is knowledge.\u201dIt is in view of the discrimination of the world possessing the characteristics of appearance and disappearance, that it is said\u201cKnowledge is but one.\u201dAs to consciousness, it is the nature of the Puru\u1e63a, not of the discriminative faculty. This, however, is not within the range of the perceptive cognition of the world. It falls within the sphere of the inferential and verbal cognitions. This is the meaning.While showing thus that nescience is the radical cause of mental phenomena, in the state of outgoing activity, it is also indicated that conjunction, the cause of nescience, is the cause of enjoyment, and also that there exists between the two the relation of the owner and the owned. For the purpose of establishing this the Commentator says,\u201cIt becomes the possession of its lord.\u201dThis shows the relationship.But the cognizer, puru\u1e63a, can only be the lord of the mind, when it enjoys the benefit of the service rendered by the mind. And it is not possible that he should so enjoy the service without coming into relationship with the benefit rendered; but it cannot be beneficially acted upon, and there it cannot come into relationship. If, on the other hand, the enjoyment of the benefit is to be considered to be due to the conjunction thereof, then the puru\u1e63a must be considered to be changeful.For this reason he says, \u201cact by mere nearness.\u201dThe mind is not conjoined to the puru\u1e63a; it is merely placed near him. The nearness of the puru\u1e63a is not in space, nor yet in time, on account of the absence of juxtaposition. It is defined by fitness. The puru\u1e63a possesses the power of enjoying as subject, while the mind possesses the power of being enjoyed. This' is meant by saying \u201cBeing seen, the mind becomes the possession of the lord.\u201dThe meaning is that it becomes the object of enjoyment by being transformed into the form of sound, &c. As to enjoyment, although it is a characteristic of the mind, being as it is a modification in the form of sound, &c., still it is spoken of as being a characteristic of the Puru\u1e63a, because of his identifications, with the modifications, on account of the absence of the conception of distinctness between the mind and consciousness.Thus is established the enjoyment by the Puru\u1e63a of the service rendered by the mind, although he is not conjoined to as is also established the unchanging nature of the Puru\u1e63a.Well then, the relation of owner and owned which is the cause of enjoyment, has its cause in nescience. But what is the cause of nescience? There must be some cause for it, because no effect can come into existence without some cause. As they say,\u201cWhat to him doth make,\u201cNescience manifest,\u201cLike dream and so forth,\u201dThis doubt is removed by putting the answer in the form of a summary:\u2014\u201cFor this reason, &c.\u201dThe meaning is this. The cause of the experience of the calm, the ruffled and the forgetful forms of mental modifications is the eternal conjunction caused by eternal nescience; and the relation of nescience and potentialization (v\u0101san\u0101, in each being born from the other in eternal succession is without a beginning like the mutual relation of seed and sprout.)",
          "Vyasa_commentary": "How then? On account of objects being presented to it, identification with modifications takes place elsewhere. The conscious principle (puru\u1e63a) is not unaffected by whatever may be the modifications of the mind in the state of outgoing activity. And so in the aphorism:\u2014\u201cKnowledge is but one; discrimination alone is knowledge.\u201dThe mind is like a magnet energized by nearness alone. Being seen it becomes the possession of its lord, the puru\u1e63a. Therefore the reason for knowing the modifications of the mind is the eternal relation of the puru\u1e63a."
